            <p>
                Did you know there are about <a href="https://axlewise.com/car-ownership-in-the-united-states/">1.4 billion cars</a> on earth?
            </p>
            <p>
                Nearly a quarter of these cars can be found in the U.S. alone. Owning a car is a great responsibility and the first thing you do is get a driver’s license. It not only allows you to operate your vehicle on the road but can also serve as your ID.
            </p>
            <p>
                But over time, your license will expire. To stay on the safe side of the law, you need to renew your license. However, renewal processes vary from state to state. Below is a complete guide on license renewal AZ.
            </p>
            <hr class="new5">
            <h2>When to Renew Your Driver’s License in Arizona?</h2>
            <p>
                Arizona has one of the most extended preliminary renewal periods in the U.S. Apart from Travel IDs that need to be renewed after every eight years, you don’t have to renew your license until you turn 65 years old. Then, you must renew it every five years thereafter.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are under 65, you may need to go in every 12 years to renew the picture on your card. In case you don’t renew your photo, your driver’s license will still be valid. But you won’t be able to replace your lost ID or access other services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) may not send a reminder to notify you about the expiration date of your old license. This is why you need to keep track of the deadline to prevent missing your renewal. Having an expired license can result in hefty fines and even jail time.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a standard Arizona license, the expiration date is at the top right corner. Usually, it’s the date you turn 65. On a travel ID license, you can find this date to the right of your photo under your name and address.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember there is no grace period for license renewal in AZ. Once your expiration date passes, you risk losing your driving privileges. You can renew your license up to six months before the expiration date.
            </p>

            <h2>How to Renew Your License AZ</h2>
            <p>
                Has your license expired? Below are different ways you can renew your drivers license according to Arizona law.
            </p>
            <h3>Renew Your Driver’s License Online</h3>
            <p>
                As of 2021, drivers can renew their licenses online. To do so, follow these steps:
            </p>
            <h4>Step 1: Sign in or Activate Your Arizona Driver’s License Account</h4>
            <p>
                <a href="https://azmvdnow.gov/home">Visit AZMVDNow.gov</a> to get started. Since every license automatically has an account, simply follow the activation steps as prompted.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 2: Visit the “My Credential” Section</h4>
            <p>
                When you reach this section, click “Renew Now” and follow the license renewal instructions. It’ll direct you to where you can make payments. 
            </p>
            <h4>Step 3: Pay a Fee</h4>
            <p>
                You will need to pay the required fee with a valid credit card. The cost to renew both a standard license and Travel ID is $10.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 4: Receive a New Driver’s License</h4>
            <p>
                It will take about 15 days to receive your new license in the mail. While you can apply for a Travel ID online, you will have to visit an office in person to submit identification documents and have your photo taken.
            </p>
            <h3>Renew Your License in Person</h3>
            <p>
                Can you access your local MVD office easily? Then you can renew your license in person. Just follow these steps:
            </p>
            <h4>Step 1: Activate Your AZ MVD Account</h4>
            <p>
                Log into your account and ensure you don’t have any outstanding fees, suspensions, and other issues on your driving record. If there are, clear them first as they can affect your license renewal process. Also, fill out and print your renewal application.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 2: Prepare Your Documents</h4>
            <p>
                You’ll need to verify your identity at the MVD. So, ensure you gather the documents needed for the renewal process, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your current driver’s license—acts as your primary ID</li>
                <li>A secondary ID— a bank/credit card or your Social Security card</li>
                <li>A doctor’s statement, if you have any medical condition you need your license to show.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Step 3: Visit Your Local MVD Office</h4>
            <p>
                To kick start the process, go to the Arizona MVD office. Ensure you schedule an appointment ahead of time.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 4: Pass a Vision Test</h4>
            <p>
                You can take the vision test on-site or bring a report from a certified optometrist. The third-party test and Vision Examination Report should be done within 3 months of your license renewal.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 5: Pass a Road Test</h4>
            <p>
                If required, you may have to pass a road test. You may need to take the test in various situations. They include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have violations on your driving record, like license suspensions or at-fault accidents</li>
                <li>Have mental or physical conditions that may affect your driving</li>
                <li>Someone filed an unsafe driver claim against you</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Step 6: Take a Driver’s License Photo</h4>
            <p>
                Have a new photo taken for your license. If you are required to wear glasses when driving, make sure you wear them when having your license photo taken. 
            </p>
            <h4>Step 7: Make Payment</h4>
            <p>
                Pay the required $10 renewal fee. You can use cash, credit card, check, or money order. Once you’re done, you will receive a temporary paper license valid for 30 days.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 8: Receive the New License</h4>
            <p>
                Your new driver’s license will be delivered in the mail within 30 days. You may also request to pick it from your local MVD office if it’s more convenient for you. 
            </p>
            <h3>Renew Your License at an Authorized 3rd Party</h3>
            <p>
                There are a lot of authorized third party agencies that offer various <a href="https://www.ggandd.com/arizona-mvd-services/driver-licenses-ids/">driver’s license services</a>. If you are considering a renewal via a third party, follow the steps.
            </p>

            <p>
                After preparing the needed documentation, simply walk into our offices to get started.

            </p>
            <h4>Step 3: Take a Photo</h4>
            <p>
                An updated photo of you will be taken. You can also bring your up-to-date photo that you’d like to use.
